## The new chronotext toolkit, for Cinder 0.8.5 & C++11

The purpose of this toolkit is twofold:  

1. Creating *dimensional text* experiments for OSX, Windows, iOS and Android (see [chronotext.org](http://chronotext.org).)  

2. Creating 2D games and interactive applications for iOS and Android, with focus on OSX as a developement and simulation platform.  

The toolkit relies on Cinder 0.8.5 for [OSX and iOS](http://libcinder.org/releases/cinder_0.8.5_mac.zip) and [safetydank's fork](https://github.com/safetydank/Cinder/tree/fecb2914adce1b081a1ed0884f1c0289b8923af8/android) for Android (Windows is temporarily not supported...)

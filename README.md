## The new chronotext toolkit, for Cinder 0.8.5 & C++11

**Post mortem:** this project is no longer maintained, superceded by the [chronotext-cross](https://github.com/arielm/chronotext-cross) project.

---

The purpose of this toolkit is twofold:  

1. Creating *dimensional text* experiments for OSX, Windows, iOS and Android (see [chronotext.org](http://chronotext.org).)  

2. Creating 2D games and interactive applications for iOS and Android, with focus on OSX as a developement and simulation platform.  

The toolkit relies on Cinder 0.8.5 for [OSX and iOS](https://github.com/arielm/new-chronotext-toolkit/wiki/How-to-(re)build-Cinder-0.8.5-for-XCode-6.1.1-and-the-new-chronotext-toolkit) and [safetydank's fork](https://github.com/arielm/new-chronotext-toolkit/wiki/How-to-build-Cinder-0.8.5-for-Android-and-the-new-chronotext-toolkit) for Android.

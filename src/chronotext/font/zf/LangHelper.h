             * most widely spoken or used language written in that script:
             * for instance, the sample language for %HB_SCRIPT_CYRILLIC

             * is no language that is sufficiently representative. The best
             * example of this is %HB_SCRIPT_HAN, where various different
             * variants of written Chinese, Japanese, and Korean all use
             * significantly different sets of Han characters and forms
             * of shared characters. No sample language can be provided
